    			<p>King Philip’s War, fought between 1675 and 1678 in Colonial America, was a conflict that, “in proportion to population… inflicted greater casualties than any other war in American history,” (Lepore 1999, xi). This war was fought between English Colonists of New England and their native allies, and the Wampanoag Tribe, among others, and heavily influenced by the settler's determination to spread Christianity to the natives. Jill Lepore’s The Name of War is a book that analyzes the influence that the war, as well as the history of the war, had on American identity. She emphasizes the importance of language in recording the history of the war, and how this played an influential role in American’s perceptions of both themselves, and their enemies. King Philip’s War, and the language used to record it, marked a beginning of racial and cultural division of colonists and natives that would later influence other historical events, such as Andrew Jackson’s Indian Removal Act. Lepore argues that it wasn’t until this war, and the writing and language used to record its history, that we begin to see a sharp cultural separation between the English colonists and the Natives, as well as the way colonists perceived them.</p>
