    			<p>The American Revolution was caused, in part, because citizens felt they were being taxed without any actual representation. Colonists in America felt the British Government had become tyrannical, and decided to fight back after negotiations never accomplished what they wanted. There were a number of protests, most notably the Boston Tea Party, leading up to a full blown war. Americans had to find a way to go up against the world's most dominant military at the time. A combination of passion for their cause, an armed militia of citizens, as well as economic and military contributions from the French were the key factors in helping America win this war. As a result, a new country was born, and George Washington became the nation's first president shortly after.</p>
